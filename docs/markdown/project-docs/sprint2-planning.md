The team members question them about the case and the acceptance criteria, which they must explain.  As a result, they should be more informed.

#### The Development Team

The development team consists of all team members who do the work, such as designers, test engineers, developers, and so on. They must attend and actively participate in the meeting. Participating actively in the meeting should result in them understanding what is expected of them and what products they must deliver before the next sprint begins.
