# Scrum Retrospective - Sprint 1 FWYI

## 1. Introduction

### Scrum master - Minh Pham

This document is a scrum artefact for the scrum retrospective of the sprint 1 of the FindYourWayIn project.

The scrum retrospective is a process where the team gathers feedback from the team members and the stakeholders to improve the quality of the product for the next sprint. 

For the scrum retrospective meeting, we follow the 4Ls: Liked, Lacked, Learned, Longed For. Those are the 4 main points of discussion in the scrum retrospective.

### 2.2. Lacked
