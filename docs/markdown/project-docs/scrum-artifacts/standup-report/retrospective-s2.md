# Scrum Retrospective - Sprint 2 FWYI

## 1. Introduction

### Scrum master - Craig Chauraya

This document is a scrum artefact for the scrum retrospective of the sprint 2 of the FindYourWayIn project.

The scrum retrospective is a process where the team gathers feedback from the team members and the stakeholders to improve the quality of the product for the next sprint. 

For this scrum retrospective meeting, we use Miro team collaborative with what was (Good, Bad) and what to (Start/Continue, Stop/Prevent).
Those are the 4 main points of discussion in the scrum retrospective.
The following text were extracted raw from the team collabrative board in Miro https://miro.com/app/board/o9J_lu7MJBs=/?share_link_id=562305786056
