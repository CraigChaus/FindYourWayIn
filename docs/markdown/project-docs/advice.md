# Advice
## Advice to Client for Future
### App Platform
Although the client requested for a web application, after doing research we have realised that this project is most suitable to be a native application that uses Google Maps Andriod or Google Maps IOS API's. These API's not only have all functionality the JavaScript API has, but also has more tools for the map such as 3D camera, map rotation, real time location sharing, more zoom and pan control etc. 

### Timing for Building The Project

Excluding the inital 2 weeks of preperation and research, our team has a total of 3 sprints or 6 weeks to build the application. Although that is enough time to build the application with required basic functionality, it is adviced to spend more time for this application. The reason behind this is due to the app being so relied on the map and that Google Maps has much to offer. Customizing the map visiually in the map editor, heatmapping, map tilting, adding info windows to markers etc. are just a few things the API is capable of. These are all tools that have potential to improve the user experince and quality of the application. However, in a time frame of 6 weeks it is not possible to have this level of functionality.

### SSO Authentication

In this project authentication is done by Firebase, a backend multi-tool from Google. For signing up email/password is used. This is a common way for signing up to an application. However, Firebase has many options for authentication these include signing up by SMS/Phone or Anonymous login which allows guest users to login temporarily. There are also options for external providers for sign in, such as signing in with Twitter, Google, Facebook, Microsoft etc. Thesedays, many people make use of these SSO options. Although we did not implement these features, these are viable options that can be done in the future.
