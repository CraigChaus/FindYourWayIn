## Advice to Client for Future
### App Platform
Although the client requested for a web application, after doing research we have realised that this project is most suitable to be a native application that uses Google Maps Andriod or Google Maps IOS API's. These API's not only have all functionality the JavaScript API has, but also has more tools for the map such as 3D camera, map rotation, real time location sharing, more zoom and pan control etc. 

### Timing for Building The Project

Excluding the inital 2 weeks of preperation and research, our team has a total of 3 sprints or 6 weeks to build the application. Although that is enough time to build the application with required basic functionality, it is adviced to spend more time for this application. The reason behind this is due to the app being so relied on the map and that Google Maps has much to offer. Customizing the map visiually in the map editor, heatmapping, map tilting, adding info windows to markers etc. are just a few things the API is capable of. These are all tools that have potential to improve the user experince and quality of the application. However, in a time frame of 6 weeks it is not possible to have this level of functionality.
