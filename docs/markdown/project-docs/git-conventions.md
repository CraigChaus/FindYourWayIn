2. Assign yourself to the chosen task.
3. Create a *Draft* merge request using the **Create merge request** button,
select **Create merge request and branch** from the drop menu, and adjust the
target branch to be the **week** branch for that workweek.
4. Add yourself as an *Assignee* on the merge request page.
5. Adjust the Milestone for the merge request to match the Sprint number.
6. *(Preferably)* Select 'Delete source branch when merge request is accepted.'
