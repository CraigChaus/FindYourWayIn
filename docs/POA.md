## Introduction
 With the growth of digitalisation and tourism, convenience is becoming increasingly important. Although there are many mapping applications most of them have the goal to simply get a user from point A to point B, without taking in consideration of the users  experience preferance.
 
The goal of this project is to address these issues by creating a personalized experience for locals and tourists via a mapping application that creates user preference based routes which relies on the products they are searching or local events they might want to attend to. Alongside, the app aims to give the user an insight of the local business/event by providing descriptions of the places which will help them to determine if the business/event is what they are looking for.
