## Introduction
 With the growth of digitalisation and tourism, convenience is becoming increasingly important. Although there are many mapping applications most of them have the goal to simply get a user from point A to point B, without taking in consideration of the users  experience preferance.
 
The goal of this project is to address these issues by creating a personalized experience for locals and tourists via a mapping application that creates user preference based routes which relies on the products they are searching or local events they might want to attend to. Alongside, the app aims to give the user an insight of the local business/event by providing descriptions of the places which will help them to determine if the business/event is what they are looking for.

# Parties involved

 - **Client** - Nils, our client, person who has a vision of the project and who makes all decisions regarding product's form and idea. He is the contact point in case we have doubts or question regarding app's core functionality or other important topics.

 - **Technical Partner** - client's partner, Arne, person who made a software for the customer before and who will assist us during the development. We will contact Arne in case of technical issues or questions about architecture or API.

 - **SSS students** - team of Smart Solutions Semester students, they have worked on shaping the original idea into more specific design, with wireframes and documentation, they will assist us in the development and also testing the iterations of the product, providing us with a feedback. We will discuss visual design, functionality and user experience related questions with SSS team, also involving Nils into the discussion, when necessary.

 - **Developers** - us, we are the ones who will work on enhancing existing design, implementing new software, and connecting it to the database provided by Technical partner.

 - **Walstraat shops** - as client said, some organizations and entrepreneurs agreed to be a part of testing environment. We can use the information of their facilities and depict it in our web app.


## Technologies Used
### Frontend
* __React__: React is a fast, component based Javascript framework which is used for developing SPAs. This makes it great for creating data visualization tools like GPS systems since it prevents the need to reload the page every time there will be a change in the map, for instance.  

* __Tailwind CSS__: For CSS we are using Tailwind. Tailwind is utility based CSS framework which provides functionality to create highly customizable styling.

### Backend 
* __Node.js__:  By using Node.js, we will be able to use the same programming language, Javascript, across the stack. Also, with Node.js we will also have access to the npm software library which might be useful in the future.

*__Express.js__: Express is a web-app framework which provides various features such as middleware, creating HTTP requests and routing.  

* __Geolocation__: The Geolocation API allows the user to provide their real-time location via the web application they are using. We are using this API to constantly access the users location in order to display it on the map component later on.
